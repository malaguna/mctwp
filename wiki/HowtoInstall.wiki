IT IS NOT COMPLETE YET, DON'T FOLLOW THIS INSTRUCTIONS 

= Introduction =

This project is a Java web application that needs a Servlet Container to work. It has been tested in Tomcat 6.0.X, but it must work with any container. So this project is packaged as a WAR file, that must be deployed into container.

It is supposed to work in any operating system supported by the Servlet Container, but it has only been tested into GNU/Linux Ubuntu Server >= 8.04.

However, it needs some other prerequisites in order to work. It uses an external XML data base to store image header's metadata. One of the included plugins need (X)!MedCon program installed (until I can link it through JNI) and finally it needs a directory (or remote file system) to store images.

This page gives you both, a minimal instructions to get project working, and a complete instructions set to build a server from scratch.

== Minimal configuration ==

If you already has a server with a Servlet Container, of course you could use it to deploy this application. So you only need to setup three elements:

=== eXist Data Base ===

You need an eXist data base instance running, but it doesn't matter where it runs. It can be into the same server as Servlet Container or another machine.
